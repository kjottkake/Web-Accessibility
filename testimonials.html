            <p>"Universal access has changed my life. Before, I struggled to use websites and apps because they weren't designed with accessibility in mind. But now, with universal access, I can use the same products and services as everyone else. It's given me more independence and autonomy, and it's made my life so much easier."</p>  </article>

            <p>"As a parent of a child with disabilities, universal access has been a lifesaver. My child can now use the same apps and websites as their friends, which has helped them to feel more included and connected. It's made a huge difference in their life, and it's made our lives as a family easier as well."</p></article>
