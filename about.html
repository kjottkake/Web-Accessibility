      <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our website on web accessibility! Our goal is to make the internet a more inclusive and accessible
        place for everyone, regardless of ability or disability.</p>
  
      <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites and web applications usable by people of all
        abilities and disabilities. This includes those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments, as well
        as users who may have temporary or situational impairments (such as those using a mobile phone in bright
        sunlight).</p>
  
      <p>Making a website accessible not only benefits users with disabilities, but it also makes the website easier to
        use for everyone. For example, clear and consistent navigation, properly-formatted content, and the ability to
        easily resize text can improve the user experience for all visitors to a website.</p>
  
      <p>We are dedicated to promoting and advancing web accessibility, and we offer a range of resources on our website
        to help you learn more about this important topic. Whether you are a web developer, designer, or just someone who
        wants to learn more about how to make the web more accessible, we have something for you.</p>
  
      <p>Thank you for visiting our website on web accessibility. We hope you find the information and resources here
        helpful and informative.</p>
