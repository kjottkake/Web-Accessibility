      <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites and web applications usable by people with
        disabilities. This includes people who are blind or have low vision, who are deaf or hard of hearing, who have
        cognitive or learning disabilities, or who have mobility impairments.</p>

      <h2>Why is web accessibility important?</h2>
      <p>Making websites and web applications accessible is important because it ensures that people with disabilities
        can access and use the same information and services as everyone else. It also helps to promote inclusivity and
        diversity, and can improve the overall user experience for everyone.</p>

      <h2>How to make a website accessible</h2>
      <p>To make a website accessible, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide alternative ways to access and interact with the content, such as through the use of assistive
          technologies like screen readers or speech recognition software.</li>
        <li>Provide clear and understandable information, using plain language and avoiding jargon or complex language.
        </li>
        <li>Use accessible design and navigation, such as providing sufficient contrast between text and background
          colors, and using clear and intuitive navigation.</li>
      </ul>
