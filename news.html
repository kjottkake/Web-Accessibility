            <h2>Australian Banknote With Accessibility Features Had Misspelling in Plain Sight For 6 Months</h2>
            <img src="./media/straya.jpg" alt="Australian 50 Dollar Banknote with red circle">
            <p>In March 2021, an error was discovered on the new $50 Australian banknote. The banknote, which was released in October 2020, featured a misspelling of the word "responsibility" as "responsibilty" on the back side of the note.

                The error was quickly acknowledged by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the country's central bank, and steps were taken to correct the mistake. The misspelled banknotes will still be accepted as legal tender, but the Reserve Bank will be recalling and destroying the faulty notes as they are returned by the public.
                
                The mistake has been attributed to a printing error, and the Reserve Bank has implemented additional checks to ensure that such errors do not occur in the future.
                
                While the misspelling has caused some embarrassment for the Reserve Bank and the government, it has also generated some amusement among the public. The error has been widely discussed on social media, with many people sharing images of the faulty banknote and making jokes about the mistake.
                
                Overall, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of careful proofreading and quality control, especially when it comes to the production of money.</p>
